# Enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in Windows 10

This repository provides a simple way to enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) on Windows 10 using PowerShell scripts. Windows 10 does support DoH, but the graphical network settings interface does **not** allow you to enable it directly. Instead, we use a registry key and configure DNS servers manually.

## ðŸ›  Why This Is Useful

- **Privacy**: Encrypts DNS queries to prevent snooping and tampering.
- **Security**: Uses Cloudflare for Families to block malware and adult content.
- **Convenience**: Automates setup with two simple scripts.
- **Bypasses GUI limitations**: Windows Settings does not expose DoH toggles.
